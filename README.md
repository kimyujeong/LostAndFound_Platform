# LostAndFound_Platform
 Lost and Found Platform Service For Cinema
 
 
 
# Introduction
I provided a ‘Lost and Found’ management platform as an Android Application to solve the inconvenience of customer service. By diziting customer service, which used to be an analog, I solved the customer inconvenience and improved the work efficiency of employees.
If the customer lose their belonings at a movie theater, the customer has to revisit the movie theater to ask their lost things. In addition, if customers visit at a crowded time, employees' in-store services and customer service may be delayed.
So, I developed a service technology platform that can reduce various inconveniences and enhance the convenience of both employees and customers.
